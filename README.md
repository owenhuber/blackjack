A simulator I have been developing to practice on blackjack strategies

- "helpahs.py" are our helper functions playing by the strategy at https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/blackjack-strategy-charts/
- "countinghelpahs.py holds our helper functions for our first card counting method, found at https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/blackjack-deviations/
- dev.py is our engine, currently playing by the chart and counting, and currently has a bug where it canot play through to the end of the four decks.
